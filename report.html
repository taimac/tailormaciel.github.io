        <h1>Web Development</h1>
       
        <div class="container">
            <article class="main-text" >
                <h3>Introduction:</h3>

                <p>The website facilitates discussion exploring theory and tools related to automated management systems, 
                    designed to streamline decision making processes. This is principally done by providing a 
                    number of thought provoking articles around different management themes. 
                    The theme of the website was motivated by my interests in both management theory and automated business systems. 
                </p>
                <p> As instructed the design of the website followed the style of a newsletter/blog both 
                    allowing readers to explore existing knowledge and theories while also being able to 
                    then engage and discuss the content. For the page structure there is a prominent question 
                    to provoke the reader with the content on the website, which I thought was important 
                    to encourage interactivity from the outset.
                </p>

                <h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</h3>  

                <p>The main inspiration behind the content came from the content itself which was primarily sourced from literature 
                    I have read around the theme of management and automated systems. Examples of this include <em>‘The lean startup’ by Eric Ries, 
                    ‘Business model generation’ by Alexander Osterwalder and ‘The blue ocean strategy’ by W.Chan.</em>

                </p>
                <p> I am also very familiar with general models of designing websites from which I drew inspiration with elements 
                    such as having cards on the main page to aid navigation and a big image or video at the top of the page to get the attention of the user.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The colours I decided on using were inspired by the palettes I observed from other websites such as the colour of a ‘call to action’ button being orange or yellow.
                </p>

                <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>

                <p> The website is keyboard friendly allowing for navigation between headings and buttons through 
                    the use of the keyboard for those unable to use a mouse or touchpad.
                </p>

                <p>I added an outline to all buttons on the website. The red colour of the outline created a significant 
                    contrast with the text of the button to increase accessibility for anyone with visual impairments.

                </p> 
                <p>	I have included Alt text for all images to assist people with visual impairments to be given a clear 
                    indication of what the image portrays through the use of screen readers.

                </p>

                <h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h3>  

                <p>I wanted to make sure that the user experience was consistent across different devices. 
                    The website is responsive and adapts to different types of screen sizes.

                </p>
                <p>	To reduce the necessity to scroll on the page users can navigate through links on the headers, in the text and on the footer.</p>	
                
                <p>	The text is centralised in the middle of the page to facilitate a more streamlined view when reading or scanning through information.</p>
                
                <h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that.</h3>  

                <p>	The most challenging aspect I had to learn and implement was how to position the elements on the page according to 
                    different types of screen to maintain the same proportions of the content. To do this I had to search on how to use CSS Grid and Flex box. 
                    To implement this required a lot of trial and error, experimenting with what worked and what didn’t, sometimes completely redoing parts.

                </p>
                
                <p> I had to learn about techniques in making websites accessible and I did this through various website searches. 
                    This influenced my choice of colours and the use of various other techniques such as Alt text, button borders and centralised text.

                </p>
                <p>Also I had to search on how to implement a slide on a website using Javascript. The code I sourced was for only one slide so I made an 
                    adaptation to create a synchronised slide to offer more information on the other slide. In this case it was a slide of a book and the other slide 
                    simultaneously provided information on the author.

                </p>

                <h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>

                <p>
                    I feel like my planning of the content and the central theme of the page went well. 
                    This was a result not only of my deep interest and knowledge around the central theme but also from the significant planning around the 
                    HTML structure which I undertook to ensure that the page would best serve this content. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with the basic implementation of the CSS was not that difficult; using the margin, paddings, 
                    colours and font size for example worked well throughout the page.

                </p>

                <h3> What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    On consideration I could have implemented a better use of cascading features. 
                    I could have also used more advanced features of DOM manipulations which if I were doing the page again I would have more time to research and implement. 
                    I would also have preferred to use more advanced CSS techniques such as the use of animations.

                </p>

                <h3> What resources were used when creating your work?</h3>
                <p> I used Figma to design the wireframes. </p>
                <p> I used a W3schools tutorial to implement the popup when the subscribe button is clicked  </p>
                <p>For the responsive hamburger, the source quoted below did not fully explain how to do to close the navegation window. 
                    So I made an adaptation of the code to work correctly.</p>
                <p>For the automatic slideshow, I did an increment in JS to synchronize two images simultaneously, 
                    one for the book, the other for the author.</p>
                <p>All the sources are in the Reference section below.</p>
