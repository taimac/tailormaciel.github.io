					<em>This is a permanent reminder to myself!</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					A wise man (my grandpa) once told me:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em><b>"It's hard to build, but it takes fractions for everything to fall apart."</b></em>
				</p>
				<p>I still miss him, his advice, his simplicity...</p>
				<p>
					It was common to see him worried about people's lives, about the poverty and pettiness that some led their lives.
				<p>
					Before he died, I wrote him a letter trying to get him away from that kind of worry and calm his heart.
				</p>
				<p>	
					He was in his 90s at the time.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>So, what kind of advice can you give someone in their 90s?</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					I also wrote how proud I was to be his descendant (I always will be) and how important he was to me, how much I loved him, among other things.</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					He was a tough guy, that kind of guy who never cries and doesn't show deep emotions, but at the same time very careful with his family.
				</p>
				<p>	
					I never sent the letter to him, I'm sorry about that.
				</p>
				<p>
					I should never again be afraid to tell someone what I'm feeling.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's not easy to find people like him, people who don't pretend to be what they're not, people who carry simplicity and deep vision of live at the same time,
					people who care about others, people who genuinely show interest in you, about who you are, not in what you have, people who hold your attention from the start.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Fortunately I've met some!</em>
				</p>
				<p>	
					There are many pretenders, selfish and idiots out there, but the world must be ruled by the simplest.
				</p>
				<p>
					I don't want to be part of the imbeciles, those who like to play with people's feelings, 
					of those who exploit those around them and then turn their backs.
				</p>
				<p>
					I don't want to mess up anyone's life, on the contrary, I want to help build something meaningful.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to be part of the solution, not the problem.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I love <em>respect</em>, <em>retribution</em> and <em>kindness</em> no matter who I'm interacting with.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<em>I also love a good conversation :) . </em>
				</p>

				<p> 
					<em>What is it like to live without no meaningful people around us?</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					But also how not to let your loved ones fall apart when interesting ones appear into your live? 
				</p>
				<p>
					How to deal with it if you are already committed to so many things, and you want everyone around you to be happy?
				</p>
				<p>
					Because as soon as you give someone more attention, or get involved in a variety of other things, someone may feel left behind.
				</p>
				<p>
					How do you handle it without letting anyone down? 
				</p>
				<p>
					Tough questions that involve a lot of attitude. <em>I still don't have the all the answers...</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>It seems like sometimes I'm trying to take more than I can, but yes, I want to make a difference in people's lives. I'm a work in progress...</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Children are not happy living alone, they are true and don't hide their feelings for long.
				</p>
				<p>
					They need someone to laugh at them, they need someone to play with without getting hurt, they need someone to grab and hold on tight.
				</p>
				<p>
					As adults, we should be guided by these principles, we should never be ashamed to make others happy, or being afraid to say we care about each other's feelings,
					that we want them to succeed, and tell those we admire and love <em>how important they are</em> and <em>how much we want they around us.</em>
				</p>
				
				<p><b><em>PS: I didn't mention pets behavior because they are not of this world. They are just adorable! They love us no matter what! :DD </em></b></p>
				<p>
					So, what do you think about it? <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@tailormaciel.com"><em>Say hello</em></a>, and share your thoughts with me. :)
